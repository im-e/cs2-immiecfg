> When executing immiecfg/binds it will: unbind all your binds, then overwrite your local config (steam/userdata) using host_writeconfig, making your old binds toast.


I'd reccomend making a copy, change to your current binds and then execute whenever you need updating them.
Having your own bind cfg is nice if you change/switch pcs or accounts, or in case you lose all your steam data/windows reinstall.
